# DAppSample
A very simple DApp application to demonstrate coding of smart contract. 
And more importantly how to deploy the contract using Truffle framework, instead of Remix IDE, to Ethereum blockchain.

The contract is deployed to Ropsten test network at contact address: 0x9Dc1C051a57d8970585DFA03Caee86d412117326 and transaction hash: 0x63d2b112df3be1b2682bbfbaebe3c2f76bfacfc1d19d3c7fc9d401a49b50bfe5
